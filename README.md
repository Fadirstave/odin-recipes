The Odin Project First Foundations Project

In this project, I have developed my first basic HTML website, which features three recipes. This website showcases my understanding of fundamental HTML concepts, including the use of links, formatting, images, proper elements, and anchors. By adhering to best practices, this project aims to build muscle memory and enhance my overall proficiency in basic HTML.
