    <p>Grilled Cheese Sandwich is a classic comfort food made by sandwiching cheddar cheese between two slices of buttered bread. The sandwich is then grilled until the bread turns golden brown and crispy, and the cheese melts to creamy perfection. It's a simple yet satisfying dish enjoyed warm.</p>
